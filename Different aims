(1) Aiding coders of cross-linguistic databases by searching through grammars and extracting some information (especially for Grambank)  

  1a) help coders get an overview of what a specific language description contains ("did you miss that articles are handled in this document?")

  1b) rank language descriptions based on prescence of key words, lenght and year of publication ("I think you should read grammar x first")

2) characterise each language based on all sources for that lgs (for this relative freq needs to be implemented, and multilingual searchers etc)

  2a) trigger values for features in grambank and compare to what humans coded for the same (what we did in the Melanesian paper)

  2b) provide this information based on all sources to the coder as possible assistance ("this language seems to have past tense")

2c) let coders via a web interface (behind password) to their own searchers in all languge descriptions for a language

(3) investigating the nature, history, clusters and trends of linguistic descriptions and compare with  typological patterns

4) extracting complex information from grammars, but not necessarily compare it to humans
